## Decalre And Assign

```javaScript
let message = "hello";
```
I decalre a variable called "message" with the let keyword and assign a string value to it using an assignment operator, ending with a semicolon.
 
I use double quotes in order to tell JavaScript that this is a string.


```javaScript
let message = "hello";
message = "world"
```
A variable is a named storage for data and stores data temporaily in a computer's memory.  

We can imagine a variable as a box of data, and this box has a sticker with the word "message" on it which is the name of the variable.

Then I store the string value "hello" in it. 

If I assign another value to this variable, the previous string 'hello' will be gabage collected by JavaScript. And the new string that we assigned will be stored in the memory location.


## Built-in Function

```Javascript
let message = "hello";
message = "world!";

console.log(message);    // Built-in Function
```
I use a built-in function called "console.log" and pass the variable ending it with a semicolon.

## Execute

I can execute this JavaScript file with Node.




## Use CamelCase Notation

CamelCase notation: the first word that you use for your variable you will have that in all lowercase, then any proceeding words you will start the first letter uppercase and the rest of that word in lowercase.

Using CamelCase notation for your variable and this helps with readability.

CamelCase notation is the a common convention in JavaScript.
